California House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices in California using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the California Housing Prices dataset from the 1990 U.S. census.

Project Overview
The project is structured as follows:

Data Loading: The California Housing Prices dataset is loaded into the notebook for analysis and model building.

Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand its structure and contents. This includes examining the features, checking for missing values, and visualizing the distribution of the target variable (house prices).

Data Preprocessing: The data is prepared for machine learning models. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Building: Several machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict house prices. The models include linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and possibly others.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score to assess their performance in predicting house prices.

Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of the findings, including the best-performing model, key insights from the data analysis, and any recommendations for further improvement.
